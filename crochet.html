            <h2 class="blueText"> Crochet projects: </h2>
            <p>As mentioned before, this isn't my full collection! I made a bunch of mini plushies for my brother and I have more bigger projects in storage, the ones displayed here are the ones I have access to.</p>
            <img class="artWork" src="images/fishBig.jpg" alt="This was a short project. I didn't feel like watching a tutorial so I free-handed it while looking at a picture from pinterest, I think it turned out okay." onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/flowers.jpg" alt="I made a few more roses for friends too! This was a good gift to give to my parents." onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/button.jpg" alt="My first ever abandoned project was meant to be a bag, but i ended it when the bottom circle became too big, after staring at it for 2 years I decided to turn it into something else, and ta-da! A button pillow! I thought it was innovative." onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/pillowStar.jpg" alt="I was originally going to use the squares to make a baby blanket, but I got too tired. After leaving it for a year or so, I made it into a pillow so that my hard work would come in use." onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/bee.jpg" alt="This one is advertised to be for beginners, but I ended up making it this year (2025) because I just wanted something quick and easy. It was helpful to learn how to switch colors though!" onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/sheep.jpg" alt="My longest project by far! I originally made it for my brother, but I ended up being too worried that he'll mess it up. Anyway, this sheep was also made before I could sew, so I used hot glue and felt to make the face. I am still proud of myself for finishing it." onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/fishSmall.jpg" alt="This was originally meant to be a keychain, but the clasp fell off. The eyes and details was made of felt that was glued on with a hot glue gun because I didn't know how to sew at the time." onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/clover.jpg" alt="Honestly, I just love the color. I made a bunch and gave some to my friends! Definately making more!" onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/doorStuff.jpg" alt="Lilly of the valley flowers and a jellyfish, small but still pretty cool things I hung on my door." onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/eggHat.jpg" alt="An egg yolk inspired beret! Made with a whole bunch of single crochet, and was one of the bigger projects I made when I first learned the magic circle." onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/strawberryHat.jpg" alt="A hat meant to resemble a strawberry! Another one that I made back in middle school! This one was a smaller piece made for my brother who was an infant at the time(it fit his head so well back then)." onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/mushroom.jpg" alt="My brother wanted mushroom, I gave him mushroom." onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/bowl.jpg" alt="Originally meant to be a start of Totoro's body, but I ended up making it too big. Now it's a trinket bowl thing." onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/greenCost.jpg" alt="A small coster to put plant jars on." onclick="openModal(this)">
            <img class="artWork" src="images/scrunchie.jpg" alt="Two scrunchies, fun to make but I never really used them!" onclick="openModal(this)">
